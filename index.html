<h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The <i>MORE BAND NAMES THAN BOSTON</i> Band Name Creator</b></font></h1>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3"><b>Vampire Jesus & The Attorneys At Law</b> is one bad-ass
band name - we know. But that wasn't the first one we thought of. We settled on that band name
after thinking of over 500,000 band names, then sifting down to just the right one. Some of them were really good;
some of them made us think about why we were ever put on this planet in the first place. So click that button -
maybe you'll want to use the band name that appears, or maybe you'll be inspired in a way you never thought you could, 
or maybe you'll want to slide down a bed of razors and land in a pool of hydrogen peroxide.
